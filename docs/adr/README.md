# Architecture Decision Records

This directory tracks the notable technical decisions made while building the IStudio compiler and toolchain.

Conventions:

- Files are numbered sequentially (`0001-*.md`, `0002-*.md`, …) and stored in chronological order.
- ADRs follow the template: Context → Decision → Consequences → Status (Proposed/Accepted/Superseded).
- New ADRs are added via pull request and referenced from commit messages when they introduce behavioural changes.

To author a new ADR:

1. Copy an existing record or the template below.
2. Fill in the sections with concise, actionable detail.
3. Update status and link related ADRs when superseding prior decisions.

```
